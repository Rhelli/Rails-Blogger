# 📑 Blogger Web App - Ruby on Rails

This project is part of a series of projects to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ 'The Global School for Remote Software Developers!').

This is another, quick project devised to practice the basics of creating Rails web apps. This time, it's a blog. However, unlike my previous [Rails blog app](https://github.com/Rhelli/Simple-Rails-Blog), this blog is a little more complex. It possesses all the features you might expect from a web blog (or any other rails based web app), at an entry level perspective.

The scope of this project covers:
  - Articles
    - Create, edit and delete
    - Index, show, edit and new pages
    - Ability to upload various image formats with articles (jpeg, png, gif)
  - Authors (users)
    - Create, edit and delete
    - Index, show and edit pages
  - Tags
    - Create, edit and delete
    - Associate/Tag articles on their creation
    - An index page of all Tags to browse articles by Tag name
  - Comments
     - Create edit or delete comments on their respective article's page
     - Timestamp for 'how long ago' comments were posted
  - Authentication
    - Protection of creation, editing and deleting user accounts, articles, tags and comments unless signed in
    - User account and article creation is open only to those signed in
    - Basic email and HTTp password authentication
